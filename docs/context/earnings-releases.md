## Earnings releases: the results press release, read by AI (2026-10-22)

The owner showed a newsletter's earnings round-up (revenue and EPS against estimates, guidance, a few lines of story) and asked: "Is there a way to get this data". Then: "Do you think we can read these 99.1 exhibit details and store it in a separate table using AI", "go ahead with a prototype", and "We don't need to build history, But you can go like a month back".

### What it is
- **The source:** a company's results press release. It is filed with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 of an 8-K carrying item 2.02. The daily SEC read (`secdaily.js`) already records every such 8-K in `sec_events`.
- **The reader:** `release-load.js` fetches the exhibit and has Claude Haiku 5.5 copy its figures into fixed fields (`releases.js`).
- **The table:** `earnings_releases`, one row per filing.
- **Display:** `/filings` lists the day's releases first ("Results reported"), and `/api/releases?symbol=` gives one company's.

### The prototype (20 releases, before anything was built)
- **Against the SEC's 10-Q figures:** revenue, net income and GAAP EPS matched on all 22 comparisons possible.
- **Against Twelve Data's EPS:** 9 of 10 matched. The miss was Danaher's $1.17, against $1.94 adjusted and $1.23 GAAP in the release; the 10-Q confirmed the release.
- **Non-results releases:** two 8-Ks that were not results (IREN's contract news, SMCI's preliminary update) were recognised as such.
- **The text check worked:** it caught the model working out a guidance range from "$8.60 billion +/- $400 million".
- **Cost:** $0.038 for all 20, about $0.002 a release.

### The rules
- **The model copies; it never computes.** Each figure comes back exactly as printed, with the scale the document states, and our code scales it.
- **Every printed figure must be in the release text,** as a whole number token (`inText`). One that is not is dropped and named in `problems`, and the page says how many were left out.
- **Two EPS figures, never one:**
  - GAAP diluted.
  - The company's own adjusted EPS, stored with its own name and what it leaves out. That includes an EPS given "excluding" an item, such as Meta's $7.40 against $3.83 reported in 2026 Q3, after its $9.89B litigation charge. Adjusted has no standard definition, so it never travels without its label.
- **Guidance is copied in the shape printed** (`guide_kind`): a range, a midpoint plus-or-minus, a percent growth, an EPS range, or other. The plus-or-minus is kept as printed (its scale can differ from the midpoint's), and the outlook sentence is kept verbatim.
- **Summaries:** two or three sentences of fact. One using buy, sell, hold, strong, weak and the like is dropped (`BANNED`).
- **Not a results release** (a business update, a contract announcement): recorded with `is_results` 0 and no figures, so it is not fetched again. A filing with no EX-99 exhibit is recorded the same way.
- **Written once.** `insert or ignore` on the filing number; a reading is never replaced.
- **Display only.** Nothing reaches the Signal.
- **No schema with many nullable fields.** The structured-output compiler refuses that, so every text field is a plain string where "" means absent (found on the prototype).

### The price provider beside it
`againstProvider` takes the `earnings_history` row within five days of the filing and says whether Twelve Data's reported EPS matches the adjusted figure, the GAAP one, or neither. Neither is shown in amber. The estimate is the provider's; the page says how far the matching figure is above or below it.

### Running it
- **The loader:** `node --use-system-ca release-load.js` is a dry run (it still calls the model); `--commit` writes. Options: `--days N` (default 4, at most 45), `--symbol S`, `--max-usd` (default 2), `--max-minutes` (default 40). Newest first.
- **The schedule:** `release-task.ps1` registers **TickrLab earnings releases**, weekdays at 07:00 local, `--days 5`, at most $2 or 40 minutes, logging to `release.log`. That is after the 04:00 nightly, whose `sec daily` phase records the previous business day's 8-Ks; a Friday's are read on Monday.
- **SEC:** two fetches a filing (the index headers, then the exhibit), sequential, declared user agent (the server's own `REPORT_TO`/`MAIL_FROM` address), 400ms apart. A 429 or 403 stops the run.
- **The first fill** (2026-10-22): 31 days back, 185 filings.

### Not covered
- **Foreign filers** (6-K instead of 8-K): TSM and the other ADRs.
- **Releases whose numbers are only in a slide deck** (EX-99.2) or in images: they come back with dashes.
- **The 10-Q cross-check is not run automatically yet.** The prototype ran it by hand. A later pass could compare each stored row with `sec_facts` once the 10-Q arrives.
